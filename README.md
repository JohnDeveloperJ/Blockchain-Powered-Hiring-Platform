# FairHiring Smart Contract Guide for HR Management

## Introduction
Welcome to the FairHiring smart contract, an innovative blockchain solution designed to enhance the hiring process. This README will guide you through the smart contract functionalities and interface usage.

## How It Works

### Transparency & Security
Our smart contract operates on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring all transactions are transparent and tamper-proof.

### Job Posting
HR managers can post job listings directly onto the blockchain, visible to candidates with the assurance of data integrity.

```solidity
function addJob(string calldata title, string calldata description) external onlyOwner
```

### Candidate Scoring
A robust scoring algorithm assesses candidates based on predefined criteria, guaranteeing a fair assessment process.

```solidity
function scoreCandidate(uint256 candidateId, uint256 experiencePoints, uint256 educationPoints, uint256[] calldata skillPoints) external onlyOwner
```

### Event Logging
Every significant action, like job postings or candidate scores, emits events that are recorded on the blockchain, providing an immutable audit trail.

### Scoring Customization
Tailor the scoring criteria for each job role with adjustable weights for experience, education, skills, and bonus points.

```solidity
function setScoringCriteria(uint256 jobId, uint256 experienceWeight, uint256 educationWeight, uint256 skillWeight, uint256 bonusPoints) external onlyOwner
```

## Interfacing with the Contract

### Adding a Job
To create a new job listing, input the job title and description. The contract will automatically assign it a unique identifier.

### Setting Scoring Criteria
Define the assessment parameters for each job using the `setScoringCriteria` function before evaluating candidates.

### Adding Candidates
Introduce candidates into the system with the `addCandidate` function, capturing essential details according to your internal criteria.

### Scoring Candidates
Utilize the `scoreCandidate` function to evaluate a candidate. Input their ID and relevant qualifications, and let the smart contract do the rest.

### Retrieving Scores
Access a candidate's total score anytime with the `getCandidateScore` function for up-to-date, reliable data.

## Best Practices

- **Conduct Regular Audits**: Regularly check the contract's event logs to ensure all processes are running correctly.
- **Ensure Privacy Compliance**: Maintain adherence to all laws and regulations concerning candidate data privacy.
- **Manage Secure Interactions**: Ensure only authorized staff interact with the contract's functions to maintain the hiring process's integrity.
